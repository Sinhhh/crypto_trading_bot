## Powered Options Trading Bot

Build an options trading bot in Python that leverages machine learning and sentiment analysis to implement these strategies effectively.  

### Introdution

In the financial markets, predicting the direction of asset prices is notoriously challenging. However, what if you could profit without knowing whether prices will go up or down, but simply by anticipating that significant price movements will occur? This is where options strategies like straddles and strangles shine.

These strategies allow traders to capitalize on market volatility rather than directional trends. By focusing on predicting high fluctuations — not specific price targets — you can potentially profit from significant movements in either direction or protect yourself against volatility.
